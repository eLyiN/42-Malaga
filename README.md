# What is 42?

42 is a private, nonprofit and tuition-free computer science school created and funded by French billionaire Xavier Niel with several partners, including Nicolas Sadirac, Kwame Yamgnane and Florian Bucher. The school was first opened in Paris in 2013.

Out of more than 80,000 candidates in France, 3,000 were selected to complete a four-week intensive computer programming boot camp called piscine (swimming pool). Any person older than 16 can register for the piscine after completing the logical reasoning tests on the website.

The school does not have any professors and is open 24/7. The training includes peer-to-peer, pedagogy, and project-based learning. All the intellectual property belongs to the students.
